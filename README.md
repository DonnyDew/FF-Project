## Requirements
Download all the CSV files for program to properly run

## How to run
You will be prompted to input a week from 0-17. 0 is for the whole entire season and is only compatible with the individual player mode. Then you will be prompted to enter a mode. What’s in the () is what you should enter. Ex: For individual player you should enter “inv”. For most of these modes you will have to know and spell correctly the NFL player correctly. 

What you will need by mode
Inv: 1 player name and their position
myTeam: The position of one player depending on the week
st: 9 different players
tvt: 18 players

## Example

## Errors with Program
If the player is not found:
Check the spelling on the name because the slightest error will mess it up including caps
If you aren’t using the examples make sure that player played in the week you are trying ex: injury or bye
Otherwise the csv file might have gone bad and you can go back to the link and redownload it. Sometimes the csv file will compress all the data into one row making it unusable.
